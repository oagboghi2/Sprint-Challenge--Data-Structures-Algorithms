Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Exercise I
A. O(n)
B. O(logn)
C. O(sqrt(n))
D. O(nlogn)
E. O(n^3)
F. 0(n)
G. 

Exercise II

b. I would first create a base case of 1 story. Next I would dividie the n-sory into halves, a lower half and a upper half. I would discard the upper half, and start the eggs from the middle story

Exercise III
a. this quicksort function would be O(n^2). If the first element in the sorted array is the pivot point, than we would only have to deal with the greater than list

bIn this scenario the algorithm would be O(nlogN). Since you are having to deal with multiple lists. The iteratve halving of our data set produces a growth curve that is really high at first and levels out pretty quickly.
